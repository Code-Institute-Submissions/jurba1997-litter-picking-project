# The Clean Bunch

The Clean Bunch website is a landing page for anyone who is looking to join The Clean Bunch litter picking group. 
The Clean Bunch is based in Monaghan, but we aim to raise awareness about the importance of responsible waste disposal and encourage others to take action in their own communities.

The website offers all the information about The Clean Bunch: A short about us section, meeting times, a gallery and a sign up form.

## Features

- **Site**
    - I chose the colors of the Irish flag for my website to pay homage to the Irish culture, but to also make a statement about the importance of unity and cooperation in tackling environmental issues.

- **The Header** 
    - The header shows the name of the group as well as one of the colors found in the Irish flag.
    - The name tells the user what we are about: we are a group of individuals that care about the environment.
