            <h2>Help The Community</h2>
            <p>
                The Clean Bunch's litter picking efforts have a positive impact on the community in many ways. 
                Firstly, removing litter from public spaces such as Rossmore park and the streets of Monaghan 
                makes them more 
                pleasant and inviting for everyone to enjoy. It can also help to reduce the risk of injury and disease 
                caused by hazardous waste and sharp objects. Secondly, a cleaner community can promote a sense of pride 
                and ownership amongst residents, which can lead to more responsible and sustainable behaviour in the 
                future.

            <h2>Help The Environment</h2>
            <p>
                The Clean Bunch's litter picking activities are not only beneficial to the community but 
                also have a significant positive impact on the environment. Litter, especially plastics, 
                takes a long time to decompose, and it poses a severe threat to the environment and wildlife. 
                By removing litter from our environment, we reduce the risk of harmful chemicals leaching into 
                our soil and waterways.The Clean Bunch's efforts to reduce litter not only improve the aesthetic 
                quality of the environment, but they also promote a healthier and more sustainable environment for 
                wildlife and future generations.

            <h2>Exercise</h2>
            <p>
                Litter picking is an excellent form of exercise that offers numerous health benefits. 
                It is an excellent way to get some fresh air and spend time outdoors, which can boost your 
                mood and reduce stress levels. Litter picking involves bending, stretching, and walking, 
                which can help improve flexibility, strengthen muscles, and increase cardiovascular endurance. 
                Additionally, litter picking requires focus and concentration, which can help improve cognitive 
                function and reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline.

            <h2>Socialize</h2>
            <p>
                Litter picking provides an excellent opportunity for people to socialize while doing something 
                positive for the community and the environment. Whether it is a formal organized event or just a 
                few friends getting together, litter picking can be a fun and social activity. Picking up litter 
                allows individuals to work together, chat, and share stories, creating a sense of community. 
                It also provides an opportunity to meet new people who share similar interests, 
                leading to new friendships and networks.
